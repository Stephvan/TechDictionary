A webhook is a way for an application to provide other application with real time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately.(What’s a Webhook?](https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/))

You could liken webhook to something that responds to an Event.

It's how PayPal tells your accounting app when your clients pay you, how Twilio routes phone calls to your number, and how WooCommerce can notify you about new orders in Slack.
