### Sendgrid
A webhook is a way for an application to provide other application with real time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. ([What’s a Webhook?](https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/))

You could liken webhook to something that responds to an Event.
