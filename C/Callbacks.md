# Callbacks

## codeburst.io

A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’. ([What is a Callback?](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced))


## Developer.Mozilla
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. [Callnack Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function))

Example: Using the example from codeburst;

```javascript
function first(){
  console.log(1);
 }

function second(){
  console.log(2);
  }
  
# Result
first();
second();
```
